## This is about the scroll trigger property in gsap.

1) Scrolling is triggered when the scroll-start meets the start and end when the scroll-end reaches the end.

2) Scrub -> make the animation smoother.

3) Pin -> as the name suggest pin the element on the screen for the time span of element scrolling.
